Meep/MPB syntax highlighting
============================
Meep[meep] and MIT Photonic Bands (MPB)[mpb] are free and open source numerical electromagnetic simulation programs. They both use a domain specific language based on GNU Guile (itself a Scheme dialect) as input. These control scripts are fed to the program to specify the setup and desired calculation.

This package provides syntax coloring/highlighting for people who use the gedit text editor to write control scripts. Almost all Meep/MPB classes, functions, variables, and constants are properly highlighted.

Installation
------------
1. Download the package as a .tar.gz archive.
2. Extract the contents.
    tar -xzvf [archive-name].tar.gz
3. Run the installation script as superuser.
    sudo ./install.sh

Suggestions and contributions are welcome.
